# TasPostcodeFinder

This is an early-stage Java project developed at the University of Tasmania. It was created as part of Assignment 1, which involved building a postcode lookup tool for Tasmanian suburbs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The program allows users to:
- View Tasmanian suburbs within a specific range of postcodes.
- Choose whether to display all suburbs in a postcode or just the first match.
- Format the output neatly with line wrapping if necessary.

The postcode data is stored in a large array, with each postcode paired with one or more suburbs.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `AssigOne223.java` â€” The driver class that starts the application.
- `PostCodesInterface.java` â€” The interface defining the expected functionality.
- `PostCodes.java` â€” The main implementation handling configuration and data display.
